Communicator project to be built to allow for clients to written in everyones
pet language.

Initial idea is to make a room-based chat were the client request the room they
want to join and all messages are shared with this room. Will need to work out
if want the server to have allowed rooms or the clients are able to create rooms
themselves. To start off with will just have a set list defined on the server.

This is using the specification found
[here](https://github.com/maccoda/comms-spec)
